        <h1>My Cat Pepper</h1>

        <p>Pepper is a grey and white cat that my wife and I adopted on August 13th, 2023.
        My aunt's co-worker found him alone in the woods in her backyard and took him in when he was just a few weeks old. She took him in and bottle-fed him but he didn't get along with the other cat in the house so he needed to be re-homed when he was around 3 months old. He's the best guy.
        </p>

        <p>Admittedly, it took time for us to get used to having Pepper but we learned about "The Rule of Threes" when getting your first pet:</p>
